#  Restaurant Booking System

##  Overview

The **Restaurant Booking System** is a modern full-stack web application designed to streamline restaurant reservations. It allows users to book tables, manage their reservations, and receive real-time updates. Admins have access to a dedicated dashboard to oversee bookings, users, and system notifications.

This project combines the power of **Node.js** and **Express.js** on the backend with a sleek **React.js** frontend, delivering a responsive and dynamic user experience. Additional features include Firebase-powered push notifications, JWT authentication, and optional OpenAI API integration for smart capabilities.
