# Restaurant Booking System

## Overview

The **Restaurant Booking System** is a modern full-stack web application designed to streamline restaurant reservations. It allows users to book tables, manage their reservations, and receive real-time updates. Admins have access to a dedicated dashboard to oversee bookings, users, and system notifications.

This project combines the power of **Node.js** and **Express.js** on the backend with a sleek **React.js** frontend, delivering a responsive and dynamic user experience. Additional features include Firebase-powered push notifications, JWT authentication, and optional OpenAI API integration for smart capabilities.

## Real-Time Features

This project utilizes **Socket.IO** for real-time communication. When running, the system will support:

* Instant updates to the admin when new bookings are made
* Live status updates for reservations

Ensure your Socket.IO server is properly configured and running with the backend.

---

## AI Features (Optional)

This project includes optional AI capabilities powered by the OpenAI API. These features can be used to:

* Automatically respond to user queries
* Enhance admin assistance with smart suggestions
* Provide intelligent booking feedback (future roadmap)

### Environment Setup for AI

To enable AI features, add the following to your `.env` file:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

If you do **not** provide a valid `OPENAI_API_KEY`, the AI features will:

* Not initialize the OpenAI API client
* Skip or disable AI-related routes
* Respond gracefully with fallback messages like:

```json
{
  "error": "AI feature is currently disabled because the API key is missing."
}
```

This ensures the backend runs safely without requiring AI configuration.
